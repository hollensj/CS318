                <h2>lo·go /ˈlōɡō/</h2>
                <h3>noun</h3>
                <h4>a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public recognition. It may be of an abstract or
                        figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a logotype or wordmark.</h4>
                <p> Color is a key element in logo design and plays an important role in brand differentiation. The importance
                        of color in this context is due to the mechanics of human visual perception wherein color and contrast
                        play critical roles in visual detail detection. In addition, we tend to acquire various color connotations
                        and color associations through social and cultural conditioning, and these play a role in how we
                        decipher and evaluate logo color. While color is considered important to brand recognition and logo
                        design, it shouldn't conflict with logo functionality, and it needs to be remembered that color connotations
                        and associations are not consistent across all social and cultural groups. For example, in the United
                        States, red, white, and blue are often used in logos for companies that want to project patriotic
                        feelings but other countries will have different sets of colors that evoke national pride.</p>
                <p>
                        Designing a good logo often requires involvement from a marketing team teaming with the graphic design studio. Before a logo
                        is designed, there must be a clear definition of the concept and values of the brand as well as understanding
                        of the consumer or target group. Broad steps in the logo design process include research, conceptualization,
                        investigation of alternative candidates, refinement of a chosen design, testing across products,
                        and finally adoption and production of the chosen mark.
